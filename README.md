### Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I am Josue Herrera, currently Software QA Engineer and Computer Science student. 

ðŸŒ± I am interested in achieving expertise in coding and test automation frameworks to enhance software product quality by following a concise testing process that can contribute to the team's achievements and success.

âš¡ Fun fact: There is always room for improvement as professionals and as individuals, but it will not be achieved until we start working on our day-to-day processes instead of focusing solely on long-term goals. So, just consider whether what you are doing now is something that truly impassions you, and that goal will be achieved in due time!
